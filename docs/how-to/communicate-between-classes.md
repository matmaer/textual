# Communicate between classes

Communicating includes exchanging data between different classes.  For example send the output generated by one class to another class like a logging widget.

Textual leverages OOP by making code re-usable which is available in Python classes.  This benefits your app for any Textual class you use directly or for any class you inherit to build your own custom classes. Naturally you can also benefit from this between your own independent classes.

Say that you inherit a Textual class, this is your "parent" class. Your class that inherits, is a called a "child".

If you have two personally created classes from the same parent class, those two classes are called "siblings".

Textual classes, and your own classes, can talk to eachother in two different ways, the choice depending on the hiearchy of the classes.

## General principles

A parent class talks to it's children by setting attributes on the child class.

A child class talks to it's parent by sending messages.

Sibling classes don't talk to eachother directly.  The "sending" sibling first send a message to the parent class, and the parent class subsequently sets an attribute on the target sibling class.

See the [Coordinating Widgets](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/widgets/#coordinating-widgets) guide.  This guide includes diagrams and an accompying example app, to illustrate these principles.
